            <p class="paragraphedText">Hi! My name is Kiran, I’m currently going to school for a mechanical engineering degree. With my free time, I pursue many different hobbies such as; STEM projects, Music production, and money things like trading and personal finance. </p>
            <p class="paragraphedText">On this site I will have blog posts about whatever I may be doing that I think would make an interesting read. I will also have more detailed sections for projects that will be their own separate thing from blogs. As well as possibly in the future some more educational focused content to share my knowledge specifically. </p>
            <p class="paragraphedText">That’s mostly what I have planned for the future of this site! I’m sure there will be something here of interest for you at some point if not yet!</p>
